ktouchxapi
==========

Colsolidate progress for all users of KTouch on a system, and send the data to a xAPI endpoint.

About
-----

This program searches all user directories on the current system, looking for statistics files
generated by [KTouch](http://edu.kde.org/applications/all/ktouch). It reads and parses this information and
converts it into actor-verb-object statements. Then it connects to a xAPI endpoint and synchronizes the statements
with the data there.

For detailed options on how to run the program, run it from the command line without options.

Installation
------------

This program is distributed using npm, so install it like so:

    sudo npm install -g ktouchxapi
