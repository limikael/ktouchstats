ktouchxapi
==========

Colsolidate progress for all users of KTouch on a system, and send the data to a xAPI endpoint.

About
-----

This program searches all user directories on the current system, looking for statistics files
generated by [KTouch](http://edu.kde.org/applications/all/ktouch). It reads and parses this information and
converts it into actor-verb-object statements. Then it connects to a xAPI endpoint and synchronizes the statements
with the data there.

For detailed options on how to run the program, run it from the command line without options.

Todo
----

Currently, the program takes a bit of time to run, and the only way to get it to continously update
the xAPI LRS would be to run it on a cron nightly. It would be really nice if it could run as a daemon
and monitor the statistics files for changes. This could be done for example using
[inotify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/inotify).

Installation
------------

This program is distributed using npm, so install it like so:

    sudo npm install -g ktouchxapi
